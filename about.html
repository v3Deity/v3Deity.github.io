  <h1>This is the page that you go to when you want to learn all about 3Deity.</h1>
  <h2>Real life details</h2>
  <p>I prefer to be mostly anonymous online, so there isn’t much I am willing to disclose. I was born in the mid 2000s. I am currently living on the east coast of Spain. I speak English and Spanish fluently.</p>
  <h2>My pseudonym</h2>
  <p>I think my username holds more significance to me than other people’s usernames to them. When I was younger I played The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, and like most kids playing the game I logically thought that the Fierce Deity was really cool. My actual name is biblical, and translates to “god’s name” or “deity’s name” in hebrew, so I chose the word deity to represent myself online, because it’s relevant to me and associated with a pretty cool character. One thing to note is that unfortunately people will think that I have a god complex for calling myself a deity, which is untrue.</p>
  <p>The three at the beginning of my name is the remnant of signing off emails with “Lots of love, Deity” which eventually evolved into “<3 Deity” until the heart phased into my pseudonym. Unfortunately online forums and games started to disallow special characters in their usernames, so eventually the less than symbol was dropped, and my name became “3Deity” or in some cases “v3Deity” as an alternate if 3Deity is taken.</p>
  <p>Most people call me “Deity” for short, although I don’t particularly care how people refer to me.</p>
