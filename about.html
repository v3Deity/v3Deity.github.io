    <h1>This is the page that you go to when you want to learn all about 3Deity.</h1>
    <h2>Real life details:</h2>
    <p>I prefer to be mostly anonymous online, so there isn’t much I am willing to disclose. I was born in the mid 2000s. I am currently living on the east coast of Spain, so my timezone is CET. I speak English and Spanish fluently. I use he/him pronouns. </p>
    <h2>My pseudonym:</h2>
    <p>I think my username holds more significance to me than other people’s usernames to them. When I was younger I played The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, and like most kids playing the game I logically thought that the Fierce Deity was really cool. My actual name is biblical, and translates to “god’s name” or “deity’s name” in hebrew, so I chose the word deity to represent myself online, because it’s relevant to me and associated with a pretty cool character. One thing to note is that unfortunately people will think that I have a god complex for calling myself a deity, which is untrue.</p>
    <p>The three at the beginning of my name is the remnant of signing off emails with “Lots of love, Deity” which eventually evolved into “<3 Deity” until the heart phased into my pseudonym. Unfortunately online forums and games started to disallow special characters in their usernames, so eventually the less than symbol was dropped, and my name became “3Deity” or in some cases “v3Deity” as an alternate if 3Deity is taken.</p>
    <p>Most people call me “Deity” for short, although I don’t particularly care how people refer to me.</p>
    <h2>My beliefs:</h2>
    <p>I am politically and socially left leaning. I believe in LGBT rights, and disagree with ALL social inequality. I strongly disagree with and disapprove of far right ideologies, especially fascism. I support my local antifa. My interests have nothing to do with where I stand politically.</p>
    <p>Personally I am an atheist but I understand the appeal of religion and the place it holds in society, so I generally support people to believe in whatever they want, to a certain point. If you use religion as an excuse for bigotry, I will still treat you like a bigot regardless. I do not care about what your book of prayer says is right or wrong. Otherwise I don’t mind what you worship.</p>
    <h2>My interests and aspirations:</h2>
    <p>My biggest interest is automotives. I am interested in anything mechanical that can move under its own weight be that a car, plane, tank, train, motorcycle, ship or rocket, I love them all.</p>
    <p>My other big interest is music. I like to think I'm a bassist but in reality I kind of suck. I listen to a lot of alternative music, be it punk, goth, metal, rock, grunge or hardcore. I'm a fan of every subgenre and subculture.</p>
    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
    <p>Q: Why are you so mysterious about your identity?</p>
    <p>A: Because... I'm actually a superhero.</p>
    <p>Q: Wait omg for real?</p>
    <p>A: Yeah deadass.</p>
    <p>Q: Do you like... fight crime and stuff?</p>
    <p>A: I guess you could say that, yeah.</p>
    <p>Q: What kind of criminals do you deal with?</p>
    <p>A: Corrupt politicians and tax evaders.</p>
    <p>Q: Wait so you're not on the streets literally fighting like batman?</p>
    <p>A: No dude I'm a giant nerd. I'd get my ass whooped.</p>
    <h2>That concludes the FAQ.</h2>
